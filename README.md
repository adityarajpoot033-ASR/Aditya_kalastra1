# Kalastra - Artisan Marketplace

Kalastra is a full-stack e-commerce platform designed for artisans and creators to showcase and sell their handmade products. It features a modern, responsive user interface and a robust backend, enhanced with AI-powered features to improve user experience.

## Project Overview

The platform serves as a digital marketplace where users can browse and purchase unique, handcrafted items. Creators can manage their own profiles, list products, and track their sales. Key features include an AI-powered chatbot for customer support and a novel speech-to-text functionality that allows sellers to list products simply by describing them verbally.

## Tech Stack

The project is a monorepo divided into a `client` and a `Server`.

### Key Directories

-   **`server/controllers`**: Contains the logic to handle incoming API requests, interact with models, and send responses.
-   **`server/models`**: Defines the data structure for the application's database collections (Users, Products, Orders, etc.).
-   **`server/routes`**: Maps API endpoints (e.g., `/api/products`) to the corresponding controller functions.
-   **`server/services`**: Encapsulates logic for interacting with third-party services like Google Gemini for the chatbot and Firebase for file storage.
-   **`client/pages`**: Each file corresponds to a major route/view in the application (e.g., Marketplace, Profile).
-   **`client/components`**: Contains a library of reusable components, from basic UI elements in `components/ui` to complex features like the `ChatBot`.
-   **`client/contexts`**: Provides global state for features like the shopping cart, making state accessible across the component tree.

## APIs & Services

-   **Internal REST API**: The `server` exposes a RESTful API for all standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations related to users, products, carts, and orders.
-   **Google Gemini API**: Powers the intelligent chatbot, providing users with assistance and product recommendations.
-   **Google Speech-to-Text API**: Used in the `AudioListingForm` to transcribe a creator's spoken product description into text, simplifying the product listing process.
-   **Firebase Storage**: Used for hosting and serving user-uploaded content, such as product images and profile pictures.
